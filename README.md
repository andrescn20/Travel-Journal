# Travel Journal

Live Demo: https://andrescn20.github.io/Travel-Journal/

I made this app as one of my firs inmmersions of React JS. Following a tutorial on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview), I was able to create my firs reusable component. 

Travel Locations are generated by mapping a JSON-like data file. Adding a new entrey to the journal is made through updating the information on said file. 

It is my desire to expand on this app, by adding to it the capability of directly receiving input on the Front-End so the user can instantly generate a new Card to display without ever touching any local file. Also, the user will have the ability to edit or delete any of the current displayed carts.
